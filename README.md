## Warning Archmain is a tool written for pure Arch, it is not recommended to use it on derivatives like EOS and Manjaro or other derivatives, although it can work the derivatives may have mutated configurations.

# Archmain - Arch System Management 
This is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the package manager in Arch Linux. The purpose of this GUI is to make it easier for users to manage packages on their Arch Linux system.

This application is very powerful because it utilizes important and necessary tools for managing the Arch Linux system. The software already uses Pikaur as an AUR helper, but it is still possible to choose to only update community packages while ignoring AUR. We recommend taking full advantage of the integrated AUR helper. [Pikaur](https://github.com/actionless/pikaur) is a very lightweight and reliable project that performs 90% of the functions of this software.
