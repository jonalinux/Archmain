# The nice levels go from -20 to 19.

# -20 is the lowest nice level, which gives it the highest priority. 
# 19 is the highest nice level, which gives it the lowest priority. Just think of the nice level as 
# "The ability of the program to play nice with other programs." The higher the nice level, the more the program will get out of the way of other programs. 
# The lower the nice level, the more it will stop other programs from using system resources.

# The scheduling class. 0 for none, 1 for real time, 2 for best-effort, 3 for idle.

# Idle
# A program running with idle io priority will only get disk time when no other 
# program has asked for disk io for a defined grace period. The impact of idle io 
# processes on normal system activity should be zero. This scheduling class does not take a priority argument.
